<h2 class="h1" style="color: rgb(1,92,171)" id="about">Sobre</h2>

Olá, sou Lucas Borsatto, desenvolvedor back-end há mais de 8 anos.

Tenho conhecimentos sólidos em Java, Node e AWS. Além disso, tenho experiência prática na aplicação de DDD, TDD e Microsserviços síncronos e assíncronos. Normalmente, tenho um papel de mentor de novos membros da equipe, tendo projetado o primeiro processo de onboarding da equipe na Ame. Também tenho a prática de ensinar pessoas com menos experiência, tendo em meu currículo diversas palestras que muitas vezes resultam em POCs que contribuem muito para o crescimento do negócio e dos projetos que atuo. Mantenho um blog no Medium sobre desenvolvimento de software e também atuei como coordenador do GDG Petrópolis por muitos anos.

Gosto muito de tecnologia, astronomia, futebol e xadrez ([Profile chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/lucasb001)).

<h3 class="h2">Understanding Accessibility in Audio Production</h3>
The advent of digital audio workstations and other digital audio tools has brought a critical shift in the audio industry by empowering amateur and professional audio content creators with the necessary means to produce high quality audio content. Yet, we know little about the accessibility of widely used audio production tools for blind and low vision people. Through interviews with 18 blind and low vision audio professionals and hobbyists, I found that accessible audio production involves: piecing together accessible and efficient workflows through a combination of mainstream and custom tools; achieving professional competency through a steep learning curve in which domain knowledge and accessibility are inseparable; and facilitating learning and creating access by engaging in online communities of blind audio enthusiasts. I reflected on the deep entanglement between accessibility and professional competency and conclude with design considerations to inform future development of accessible audio production tools.

<h3 class="h2">Understanding Peer-To-Peer Support Exchange in an Online Community for Blind Audio Producers</h3>
Exchange of peer-to-peer support in online Q&A communities plays an instrumental role in helping people learn and use complex software tools. While prior work has documented how disabled people support each other in finding accessible practices and workarounds in different contexts, research on understanding their participation in dedicated online Q&A communities has been limited. Through the analysis of 180 conversation threads consisting of 1140 posts in an online text-based Q&A community of blind and low-vision audio producers, I revealed various strategies members in this community use to formulate their queries and provide effective solutions regarding screen reader based navigation of complex graphical user interfaces. I reflected upon my findings to discuss the complexities blind and low-vision software users face in developing a shared understanding during collaborative troubleshooting through textual conversations and reimagine how online Q&A platforms could enhance peer-to-peer instructional support among screen reader users.

<h3 class="h2">Enhancing Accessible Interactive Tutorial Creation by Blind Audio Producers</h3>
Audio production is a skilled practice that requires mastery in highly complex software and hardware tools. Blind audio producers face a steep learning curve where they must learn multiple inaccessible audio production tools in conjunction with workarounds for screen reader support. Learning audio production is made even more challenging due to a scarcity of educational resources geared towards blind people. Grounded in my formative interviews and observations with seven blind audio production instructors, I designed Tutoria11y, an extension for GarageBand to support blind audio producers in creating accessible, interactive tutorials that screen reader users can follow to receive step-by-step guidance and confirmation of their actions. Findings from my design exploration sessions with five blind instructors highlight how Tutoria11y can support tutorial creation and augment tutorial playback for blind audio producers. I discussed how we can rethink technology’s role as a means to amplify, rather than replace, the knowledge of disabled experts.

<!-- **DESIGNING FOR ACCESSIBILITY IN AUDIO PRODUCTION AMONG BLIND AND LOW VISION PEOPLE**  
*Dissertation Committee: [Anne Marie Piper (chair)](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ampiper/){:target="_blank"}, Darren Gergle, Marcelo Worsley, and Shaun Kane* 

In this project, I use interviews, observations, and content analysis to understand how people with vision impairments use mainstream and custom-made software and hardware tools to produce audio content. Taking their current work practices into account, I design accessible tools to support accessible learning in audio production tools for blind audio producers.


<h3 class="h2">Past Projects</h3>
**DESIGN OF SMART TECHNOLOGIES FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER**    
*Mentors: [Shameem Ahmed](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~ahmeds/){:target="_blank"}  and  [Moushumi Sharmin](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~sharmim/){:target="_blank"}*

In this project, we did a systematic literature review and qualitative coding of scholarly articles regarding smart technologies (wearables, smartphones, VR devices etc.) designed to support autistic children. We devised a set of design implications to guide the development of autism support smart technologies.  
<br/>
**DEVELOPMENT OF TESTING METHODS FOR VEHICLE ROAD DEPARTURE MITIGATION SYSTEMS**  
*Mentor: [Stanley Chien](https://et.iupui.edu/people/schien){:target="_blank"}*

In this project sponsored by [Toyota Collaborative Safety Research Center](https://www.toyota.com/csrc/){:target="_blank"}, I worked on the development of standard testing equipment and methods to evaluate the performance of Road Departure Mitigation systems of self-driving vehicles.
