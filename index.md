Hi, I’m Lucas Borsatto, 

I’m back-end developer with over 10 years of solid experience in Java, Node, and AWS.
Additionally, I have practical experience in applying DDD, TDD, and synchronous and asynchronous microservices with event driven or Restful APIs. My work always focuses on resilience, availability, and meaningful metrics.
I often take on a mentoring role for new team members, often creating or improving the team's onboarding and architectural drawings. I also have a strong practice of teaching less experienced colleagues, with several talks to my curriculum that often result in POCs, which significantly contribute to the growth of the business and the projects I work on. I maintain a blog on Medium about software development and have served as the coordinator of GDG Petrópolis for many years.

I’m really into technology, astronomy, soccer, and chess (I accept challenges on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/lucasb001)).

<h3 class="h2">Understanding Consistency in Databases: Beyond the basics</h3>

A basic implementation aimed at showing common corner cases when dealing with high throughput and lots of transactions. I explore solutions like isolation levels and locking strategies.
